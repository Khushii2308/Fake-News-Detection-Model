This Fake News Detection model is a Python-based tool that uses machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as real or fake. It preprocesses text, extracts features, and applies algorithms like Logistic Regression or Random Forest to predict the credibility of news content. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can be deployed for real-time fake news detection.
